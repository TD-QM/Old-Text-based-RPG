# Old-Text-based-RPG
An old text-based RPG that I made in the golden years of 2020 when I had nothing better to do. I suppose it was technically for an assignment, but it that only realistically should've taken a couple hours rather than spending 3-4 hours a day for an entire week during your spring break. <br>
It was also just a way to express my more "creative" side I guess? It has an alright story, but it falls off hard at the end of each line. I only like the nightmare route because I think it has the most interesting mechanics. You can't really do much outside of a turn-based combat system though. Maybe I could come back to the idea of a turn-based game, and make give it a bit more randomness. Like give it a deck-building theme and make it a roguelike game. I already pulled a ton of ideas from Slay the Spire like the intent system as well as some of the enemy attacks. That's up to future me to do, if I ever decide to do it.
